#Project Description: 

This project explores how artificial intelligence can automatically extract critical safety information from medical device reports submitted to the FDA. Specifically, we focused on surgical mesh-related reports to identify adverse events and create structured summaries that would otherwise require manual review.
We tested the LLaMA 2 (13B) generative AI model using two approaches: first, using the model independently with zero-shot prompting (where the AI works without prior training examples), and second, combining it with Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), which enhances the AI's responses by providing relevant context from existing documents.
The model was designed to automatically generate structured summaries—extracting key details such as report dates, hernia types, and adverse event indicators—and to identify specific adverse events from unstructured report text. This automation has the potential to significantly accelerate medical device safety monitoring and improve patient protection by enabling faster identification of safety concerns.
